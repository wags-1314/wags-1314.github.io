# Work Experiences
### Graduate Research Assistant @ The University of Utah
- Researching ways to automatically explain sources of errors in floating point operations.
- Currently working on extending the [Herbie](https://github.com/herbie-fp/herbie) tool to generate English explanations for errors.

### Teaching Assistant @ The University of Utah
- Worked as a graduate teaching assistant for the course CS 3810: Computer Organization.
- Responsibilities included conducting office hours and grading assignments.
	
### Teaching Assistant @ BITS Pilani, Goa Campus
- TA for several courses: Operating Systems(twice), Compiler Construction, Computer Networks, Computer Architecture, VLSI Design(Graduate Course), Discrete Structures for Computer Science, Computer Programming.

### Intern @ Stem4All
- Worked as an intern at STEM4ALL, a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization focused on STEM skills development of youth.
- Designed, conducted, and taught a week-long Python and Virtual Robotics Summer Camp for 3rd to 6th-grade students in the
US

# Projects
### Indian Sign Language Translator, with Prof. Sougata Sen @ BITS Pilani, Goa
- Research involved conversing with actual Indian Sign Language users at a disabilities school to learn the semantics and usage of Indian Sign Language, and to gauge interest in a portable translator.
- Investigated ways, included beam search and Hidden Markov Models, to predict how signed gestures transition between each other.

### Formalizing automatons with Prof. SP Suresh and Prof. Anup Basil Mathew @ Chennai Mathematical Institute
- A summer project to formalize some basic theorems on DFAs and NFAs in the Coq Proof Assistant.
- Proved some basic operations on DFAs, like the construction of complement, union and intersection.
- Proved construction of NFAs from DFAs and DFAs from NFAs, and as a consequence proved their equivalence.

### Natural Deduction Proof Checker, [source](https://github.com/wags-1314/nat-deduct/)
- An educational tool to help second-year students write proofs in Natural Deduction correctly.
- Currently supports propositional logic only.
- Each proof statement needs a justification attached to it.

### Trinity Game Engine, [source](https://github.com/wags-1314/trinity/)
- A game engine bundled with a VM-interpreted language.
- The Core language is compiled into a custom byte-code, which is then interpreted by a handwritten virtual machine.
- The compiled byte-code is then connected to the game engine, and instructions control what is drawn on the screen

### Logic in Coq, [source](https://github.com/wags-1314/logic-in-Coq)
- A formalization of classical propositional logic in Coq, along with a formalization and proof of the soundness of Natural
Deduction for propositional logic in Coq.

### Adapting proof assistants into CS courses with Prof. Anup Basil Mathew @ BITS Pilani, Goa
- Worked on the Coq Proof Assistant and its applications in formalizing mathematics and algorithms.
- Some theoretical parts of our discussion about the constructive logic of Coq were adapted into future offerings of Prof. Anup Basil Matthew's Discrete Structures in Computer Science course.

### CheemScheme, [source](https://github.com/wags-1314/cheem-scheme)
- This is a dialect of Scheme implemented in C++.
- Currently supports arithmetic operations, variables and state, conditional branching, and lambdas.
- The interpreter also optimizes tail recursion and can identify and report syntax and runtime errors.

# Positions of Responsibility
### Core Member of the Literary and Debate Club @ BITS Pilani, Goa
- Organized Inverse, a national-level slam poetry contest.

### Sub Coordinator of the Quiz Club @ BITS Pilani, Go
