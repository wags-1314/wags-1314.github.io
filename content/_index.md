## Overview

Hi, I am Bhargav Kulkarni, a Computer Science Master's student at the University of Utah. I am currently working with [Prof. Pavel Panchekha](https://pavpanchekha.com/) at the University of Utah on generating English explanations for floating point expressions. In the past I worked on adapting the Coq interactive theorem prover to education settings at the BITS Pilani, with Prof. Anup Basil Mathew. I am interested in everything computers, with a particular interest in programming languages.
